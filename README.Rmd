RevBayes offers models to infer host-repertoire evolution, but no tools to parse the outputs. evolnets has the necessary tools to reconstruct ancestral ecological networks based on posterior probabilities of interactions. 


## Installation

You can install evolnets like so:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("maribraga/evolnets")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(evolnets)
## basic example code
```
