#' evolnets: a package for parsing outputs from inference of host-repertoire evolution
#'
#' The evolnets package provides three categories of important functions:
#' rates, ancestral states and samples.
#'
#' @section Rates functions:
#' The rates functions are used to calculate effective rates of host-repertoire
#'     evolution.
#'
#' @section Ancestral states:
#' The ancestral states functions are used to calculate the posterior probabilities
#'     of host-parasite interactions at internal nodes of the parasite tree or at
#'     specific time points in the past.
#'
#' @section Samples:
#' The samples functions perform calculation for each sampled host-parasite
#'     network during MCMC.
