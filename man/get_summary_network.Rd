\title{Get summary networks from posterior probabilities of interactions of extant
lineages at given time points in the past}
\usage{
get_summary_network(pp_at_ages, pt, weighted = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pp_at_ages}{List of matrices with posterior probabilities for each
interaction of extant lineages at given ages}

\item{pt}{Probability threshold to include an interaction in the network.
Interactions with pp < pt will be dropped.}

\item{weighted}{Logical. Use posterior probabilities as interaction weights?}
}
\value{
summary network (incidence matrix)
}
